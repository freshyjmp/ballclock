# ballclock
This was completed for an employer-sponsored coding challenge. The code models the behavior of a rolling-ball clock as shown here: www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgcjJySoeTw

The program takes up to two arguments - the first sets the number of ball bearings, is required, and must be between 27 and 127. The second argument is optional and will specify the number of minutes for the program to count before displaying the position of each ball in JSON.
